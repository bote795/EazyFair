![example](https://i.gyazo.com/ad9c97b218014713b141407327bba278.png)

Then the areas 115, could be selected and this area would be then known as 115 or whatever it was told to be known as.

Then 115, can be associated with something else for example: We could say it can be google
and 116 can  be Wells Fargo. 
Then when you are a convention center or career fair and choose google would light up.
